# Entry 1: Performing Arts, Center Stage
##### 10/11/25

## Choosing a topic

The topic that I chose to do for my freedom project is __performing arts__ as I have always enjoyed the live entertainment brought by performing arts, along with the feeling of being the one on stage and performing. I have participated in back stage crew back in middle school and wanted to try out another aspect of theatre in high school which is stepping up to the next level and actually being on stage (even though it took a lot of courage), instead of behind the scenes. This decision allowed me to experience how it felt working together with the crew and cast, learning songs, blockings, technology, choreography, and the feeling of opening/closing night when we successfully deliver the performance that we have worked so hard together for. It made me realize that in order to have a memorable and magical aspect a show, technology is important and helpful in bringing out the visual aspects such as sounds effects, lighting, automation, stage deisgn, etc. Lastly, my backup ideas, were telecommunications and hospitality.

## Sources

One article that helped me see how important and needed technology is to bring out the most magical aspects and help enhance the performance, along with making actors feel more into the moment is ["How Technology Has Changed Theatre"](https://www.alltalent.com/article/how-technology-has-changed-the-theatre) by alltalent. This website talks about how technology can make threatre visuals more surreal and improve the production by using wireless mics, sound music, scent, technical props, etc. ["Center Creative Technology"](https://www.juilliard.edu/stage-beyond/center-creative-technology) by Juilliard is a great website that shows (with images) how much technology can/have changed/impacted those aspects of performing arts. Even though I didn't choose telecommunications or hospitality, two websites that helped me understand the use of technology in those two fields were ["Technology Telecommunications"](https://www.statista.com/markets/418/technology-telecommunications/?srsltid=AfmBOoo8tP5NQohZwbx9y0QfvupULaCcKdxw-I2l56qTmEzoUmPvNX_o) by Statista and ["Role Technology Hotels Enchancing Efficiency And Guest Satisfaction"](https://online.jwu.edu/blog/role-technology-hotels-enhancing-efficiency-and-guest-satisfaction/) by JWUONLINE.

## Engineering Design Process

Right now I am researching how technology has helped improve performing arts in both a positive but also negative way. This way I can see how it might cause problems even though it is a positive aspect but to also solve that problem with using technology to fix what it has caused. Using those knowledge, it would allow me to buuld a website on teaching others how technology has impacted the performing arts field and to also include ways to solve yet still keeping the surreal experience of the show by incorporating tech that causes less problems and enchances performance just the same.

## Skills

Two of the most important skills that i have learned from working on this blog entry are __time management__ and __creativity__.

# Time Management

I have learn to use my time better when working on this blog because as a high school student who has many other commitments outside of school time, its important for me to set up a schedule and know how to organize my other responsibilities. For example, I am on the girls varisty tennis team as one of the starting 7 of the season, so it's important for me to arrive to practice and games everyday as well as balancing my grades since I get home late.
