# Entry 1: Performing Arts, Center Stage
##### 10/11/25

## Choosing a topic

The topic that I chose to do for my freedom project is __performing arts__ as I have always enjoyed the live entertainment brought by performing arts, along with the feeling of being the one on stage and performing. I have participated in back stage crew back in middle school and wanted to try out another aspect of theatre in high school which is stepping up to the next level and actually being on stage (even though it took a lot of courage), instead of behind the scenes. This decision allowed me to experience how it felt working together with the crew and cast, learning songs, blockings, technology, choreography, and the feeling of opening/closing night when we successfully deliver the performance that we have worked so hard together for. It made me realize that in order to have a memorable and magical aspect a show, technology is important and helpful in bringing out the visual aspects such as sounds effects, lighting, automation, stage deisgn, etc. Lastly, my backup ideas, were telecommunications and hospitality.

## Sources

One website that helped me see how important and needed technology is to bring out the most magical aspects and help enhance the performance, along with making actors feel more into the moment is ["How Technology Has Changed Theatre"](https://www.alltalent.com/article/how-technology-has-changed-the-theatre). This website talks about how technology can make threatre visuals more surreal and improve the production such as using wireless mics, sound music, scent, technical props, etc. ["Center Creative Technology"](https://www.juilliard.edu/stage-beyond/center-creative-technology) is a great website that shows (with images) how much technology can/have changed/impacted those aspects of performing arts. Even though I didn't choose telecommunications or hospitality, two websites that helped me understand the use of technology in those two fields were ["Technology Telecommunications"](https://www.statista.com/markets/418/technology-telecommunications/?srsltid=AfmBOoo8tP5NQohZwbx9y0QfvupULaCcKdxw-I2l56qTmEzoUmPvNX_o) and ["Role Technology Hotels Enchancing Efficiency And Guest Satisfaction"](https://online.jwu.edu/blog/role-technology-hotels-enhancing-efficiency-and-guest-satisfaction/).
