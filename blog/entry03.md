# Entry 3: Brainstorming
##### 12/1/2025

## Content
After researching both the existing hardware and software technology involved in performing arts, I started to pay more attention to what technology in the future can help with advancing the experience of theatre for all.

I first wanted to search up problems that are in the entertainment industry to get a starting point in possible future existing technologies to get a idea of where and how to start, I realized out that it is important for theatre to not cause a burnout for the actors to make the experience more enjoyable. Using this information, I came up with an idea that can help solve that problem like making lines and songs easier to memorize for actors since that is a very tiring but important part in taking on a role that requires repetition to be ingraved into the brain. Using that, the idea of an small AI device, much like Alexa, designed specifically for memorization for actors became one of my future possible technologies. There are a lot of technology that is already existing that helps enhance the visual aspects of performing arts so I would need to become more creative with what isn't existing yet, so another future technology that I brainstormed was floor spotlight under the stage.I think that it would be useful to add more magical elements to the performance and can be easier for filming.

I finalized all of my content to get ready for my website by making sure that I have enough information in my part A categories along with the images and enough brainstorms for my part B. I organized my bullet points into one bullet point if they have similar ideas that I can combine into one sentence. 

## Sources
Some of my sources for my content for my website was taking inspiration of other previous students websites. For example, I looked at many website that was made by previous students such as [Anna](https://annad2694.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/)'s project where it gave me inspiration on stages, visuals, and filming for my future technology. [Angela](https://angelal4844.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/index.html)'s and [Junjie](https://junjiel4616.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/)'s website gave me inspiration on future technology and detail that I could include in my part B for my website.
