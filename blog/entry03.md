# Entry 3: Brainstorming
##### 12/1/2025

## Content
After researching both the existing hardware and software technology involved in performing arts, I started to pay more attention to what technology in the future can help with advancing the experience of theatre. I first wanted to search up problems that are in the entertainment industry to get a starting point in possible future existing technologies to get a idea of where and how to start, I realized out that it is important for theatre to not cause a burnout for the actors to make the experience more enjoyable. Using this information, I came up with an idea that can help solve that problem like making lines and songs easier to memorize for actors since that is a very tiring but important part in taking on a role that requires repetition to be ingraved into the brain. Using that, the idea of an small AI device, much like Alexa, designed specifically for memorization for actors became one of my future possible technologies.
