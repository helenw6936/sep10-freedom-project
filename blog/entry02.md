# Entry 2: Researching Information

## Content 

Having chosen performing arts as my topic for my freedom project, I had to do many researches about both the software and hardware technology that exists within the performing arts industry to educate others on. There are many different forms software technology used in performing arts such as ["Encore+"](https://www.encoreplus.app/accessible-performances/), ["Dramarts"](https://www.dramarts.com/landing), and ["Performing Arts Empire"](https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/performing-arts-empire/id6745223804). There are also many hardware technologies used in the entertainment industry including ["Electro-Voice"](https://www.electrovoice.com/applications/performing-arts/), ["Projection-Mapping"](https://www.heavym.net/unveiling-the-art-of-projection-design-theater-use-case/), and ["VR&AR"](https://amt-lab.org/blog/2021/8/how-vr-and-ar-are-changing-the-world-of-immersive-theater).

#### Software Technologies
* [Encore+](https://www.encoreplus.app/accessible-performances/) is a mobile-first web app that allows people to access services that are offered by many performing arts organizations such as accommondations for wheelchair-accessible seating, assistive listening devices, interpretive services, etc. The app also allows for viewers to obtain information about the performance like digital programs, event information, advertising, cast/crew details which makes it easier to access than trandition printing.
* [Dramarts](https://www.dramarts.com/landing) is another productive app that is designed to make it easier for performers to access schedules, script editing, and communications when it came to performances. The app involves different aspects such as internal and external communicatiosn for sharing information and photos/videos, it makes it easier for performers to coordinate their life by planning rehearsals suitable and centralizing contracts between the actors and companies.
* [Performing Arts Empire](https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/performing-arts-empire/id6745223804) is a  app that can be easily managed and track through with an account, it helps people with booking available classes, events, and announcements through the app.

#### Hardware Technologies
* [Electro-voice](https://www.electrovoice.com/applications/performing-arts/) is a sound amplification device that helps advance the audio for performances. it allows a wide set of courage through different sizes of stages and is high in speech intelligibility for a clean natural sound mix for both voices and music. it can blend into the architecture while filling the room with superior audio quality and ranges of choices to precisely bring top-tier audio performance to audience-centered spaces of every size and shape.
* [Projection-Mapping](https://www.heavym.net/unveiling-the-art-of-projection-design-theater-use-case/) involving a projector with sensors and trackers for creating a immersive and cost-effective visual experience. It helps add depth, animation, and optical illusions to set without entensive physical construction. o it turn an object, building, or surface into a dynamic video display. By using specialized software, a video or image is warped to perfectly fit the contours of the surface
* [VR&AR](https://amt-lab.org/blog/2021/8/how-vr-and-ar-are-changing-the-world-of-immersive-theater) used as a hardware in performing arts creates an immersive experiences for audiences and provide unique training tools for performers which also helps with enabling new forms of interactivity in the show.

#### Researches
In order to find information and technologies that people are not all informed about, I had to do many google searches in websites like [Gale Academic Onefile](https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=nysl_me_76_tele&da=true&origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2Fretrieve.do%3FtabID%3DT004%26resultListType%3DRESULT_LIST%26searchResultsType%3DSingleTab%26retrievalId%3Dabdd1bca-3514-4465-8a6e-1bcbda7b9129%26hitCount%3D7%26searchType%3DBasicSearchForm%26currentPosition%3D3%26docId%3DGALE%257CA671513755%26docType%3DArticle%26sort%3DRelevance%26contentSegment%3DZONE-MOD1%26prodId%3DAONE%26pageNum%3D1%26contentSet%3DGALE%257CA671513755%26searchId%3DR1%26userGroupName%3Dnysl_me_76_tele%26inPS%3Dtrue&prodId=AONE) that took me to find softwares technology that is involved in performing arts and using those information to search for the offical website of those apps. For hardware technologies, i started off with "performing arts devices" which showed me an overview of all technologies involved and then I picked from those involved to do individual researches about.
