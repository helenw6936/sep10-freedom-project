## Content 

Having chosen performing arts as my topic for my freedom project, I had to do many researches about both the software and hardware technology that exists within the performing arts industry. There are many different forms software technology used in performing arts such as ["Encore+"](https://www.encoreplus.app/accessible-performances/), ["Dramarts"](https://www.dramarts.com/landing), and ["Performing Arts Empire"](https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/performing-arts-empire/id6745223804). Encore+ is a mobile-first web app that allows people to access services that are offered by many performing arts organizations such as accommondations for wheelchair-accessible seating, assistive listening devices, interpretive services, etc. The app also allows for viewers to obtain information about the performance like digital programs, event information, advertising, cast/crew details which makes it easier to access than trandition printing.
